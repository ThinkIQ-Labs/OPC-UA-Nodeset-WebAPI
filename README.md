# OPC UA NodeSet Utilities WebAPI

## Summary

This project grew out of a collaboration with [CESMII](https://www.cesmii.org/).
It allows loading, editing, creating and saving of OPC UA NodeSet information models.
The work is targeted specifically for Information Models, as described in [OPC 10000-5: UA Part 5](https://reference.opcfoundation.org/Core/Part5/v104/docs/).
It presents a wrapper for the [CESMII NodeSet Utilities](https://github.com/cesmii/CESMII-NodeSet-Utilities)
in form of a .NET Core Restful WebAPI, which can be hosted on any system that can run modern
multi-platform .NET WebAPI's. It further allows us to interface with UA NodeSets from any platform
that can make web requests, thus reducing the entrance barrier to programatically accessing and
manipulating OPC UA NodeSets.

## Getting Started

The best way to explore the project is to take a look at the [OPC UA WebAPI Docs](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/38182923/2sAYk8tMyh#intro).

In the documentation you can download the Postman collection so you can test the API.
