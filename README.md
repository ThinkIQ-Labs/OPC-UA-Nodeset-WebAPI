# OPC UA NodeSet Utilities WebAPI

## Summary

This project grew out of a collaboration with [CESMII](https://www.cesmii.org/). It allows loading, editing, creating and saving of OPC UA NodeSet information models. 
The work is targeted specifically for Information Models, as described in 
[OPC 10000-5: UA Part 5](https://reference.opcfoundation.org/Core/Part5/v104/docs/). It presents
a wrapper for the [CESMII NodeSet Utilities](https://github.com/cesmii/CESMII-NodeSet-Utilities) 
in form of a .NET Core Restful WebAPI, which can be hosted on any system that can run modern 
multi-platform .NET WebAPI's. It further allows us to interface with UA NodeSets from any platform 
that can make web requests, thus reducing the entrance barrier to programatically accessing and 
manipulating OPC UA NodeSets.

## Getting Started

The best way to explore the project is to take a look at the 
Swagger documentation. The api is locally available in SMIP (CESMII's smart manufacturing innovation platform) and ThinkIQ instances.

If you rather use Postman, you can import the collection from the `Postman` file in the root of the project.

### Locally Stored UA NodeSets

Depending on the use case, some NodeSets are standard dependencies. The system can store, retrieve, 
upload and delete NodeSet XML files. This endpoint allows a system to be deployed without any local 
NodeSet files and then casually populated by the user. It also allows the removal of UA NodeSets in 
order to upload newer versions. Multiple versions of the same NodeSet could be stored, as long as 
different file names are used.

- GET /LocalNodeset: to retrieve file names, namespaces, version, release dates and dependencies of all locally stored UA NodeSets
- PUT /LocalNodeset: to upload an XML file, which will get stored on the server once it successfully passes as a legit UA NodeSet file
- GET /LocalNodeset/fileName: to download the full XML content of a stored UA NodeSet
- DELETE /LocalNodeset/fileName: to delete a stored UA NodeSet

### UA NodeSet Projects

The entrance point into the api is the notion of a project. Projects are stored in memory and present 
the context of where multiple NodeSet namespaces are loaded, resolved, and offered for exploration and
modification. To create a project, all that is needed is a name - the system will provide a unique id
that can be used to work with the project. Projects contain a log to be able to review certain transactions.
Projects are deleted simply by providing the id to the delete route.

- GET /NodesetProject: to obtain all existing projects
- PUT /NodesetProject: to create a new project
- GET /NodesetProject/id: to obtain a project by id
- DELETE /NodesetProject/id: to delete a project by id

### UA NodeSet Models

Once we have a project, we probably want to include a few nodesets to work off of. At the very least 
we would want to load what is commonly refered to as namespace zero: http://opcfoundation.org/UA/. Nodesets 
can only be loaded if all required resources are in place - so the sequence of loading nodeset files
is important. Nodesets can be loaded from the server, if available, or by uploading a nodeset file.

- GET /NodesetProject/id/NodesetModel: to obtain all nodesets for a project
- PUT /NodesetProject/id/NodesetModel: to create a new nodeset in a project
- POST /NodesetProject/id/NodesetModel/LoadNodesetXmlFromServerAsync: to load a nodeset from the server
- POST /NodesetProject/id/NodesetModel/UploadNodesetXmlFromFileAsync: to load a nodeset by uploading a file

*Note: When nodesets are added to a project we use the namespace uri as a key for further drill down. Because 
Azure web app's don't do slashes well in url's of resource-style web api's, we remove the slashes.*

> Roadmap: Be able to load a nodeset and its dependencies from a cloud library by namespace name. One could argue this may be outside the scope of this project. SM apps (smart manufacturing apps) already do this using either the OPC UA Foundation's or CESMII's cloud libraries and interface xml source text with this api.

### Data Types

We can retrieve and create data types.

### Objects and Object Types

We can retrieve and create objects and object types.

### Properties, Data Variables and Data Variable Types

We can retrieve and create properties, data variables, and data variable types.
